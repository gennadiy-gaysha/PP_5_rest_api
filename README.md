## Objective

The purpose of this API is to deliver a robust, efficient, and secure data 
backbone for the 
[ART SHOWCASE](https://pp-5-art-showcase-1029cf70a456.herokuapp.com/) 
front-end project. My goal is to develop straightforward, clear, and functional 
models that accurately represent the necessary data for the project. Each API 
endpoint is designed with a specific function in mind, ensuring that data 
interactions are intuitive and meet the project's needs. Comprehensive testing 
is conducted to secure these endpoints against unauthorized Create, Read, 
Update, and Delete operations, safeguarding the integrity and privacy of the 
data.
